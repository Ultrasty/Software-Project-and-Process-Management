#### 1.1 Background

With the development of platform like steam and GOG, digital games seem to be the very first choice for computer gamers nowadays. However, gamers of other gaming console still tend to buy entity games for purpose of collecting or others, and this market is still booming with more and more gamers buying game consoles. However, there doesn’t exist a comprehensive platform for players to buy entity games of different consoles from different video game companies. So here comes ICE! 

ICE is an online store selling entity games from different game companies for gamers owning different gaming consoles. Authorized by the game publishers, we sell only the legal copies and provide an easy access to purchasing entity games. Besides, we encourage players to discuss the game products freely, thus to build a community gathering players from all over the world.

Before the appearance of ICE, the usual way for gamers to buy entity games is buying them on online retailers like Taobao, Amazon, and so on. There are several problems about this. First, most of those entity games sold on those websites are from personal business rather than official, which will cast doubt on the quality of the products. They could be illegal copies or second handed. Additionally, the prices of the products can float because of the lack of official rules, thus chances are that gamers buy a product at a unnecessary high price. Another relative safer way to buy entity games is buying them on the official websites of the games or the publishers. However, it annoys people that they have to create different accounts for varied websites to buy games they want.

As is demonstrated above, there is an vacancy of a comprehensive entity game market where gamers with different game consoles can buy absolute legal copies of the entity games they want and publishers can attract all sorts of gamers to try their games. Actually, ICE can also serve as a community besides a store.
