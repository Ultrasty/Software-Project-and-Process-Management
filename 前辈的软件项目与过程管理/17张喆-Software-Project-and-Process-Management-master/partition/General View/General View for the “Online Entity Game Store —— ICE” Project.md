## Background

With the development of platform like steam and GOG, digital games seem to be the very first choice for computer gamers nowadays. However, gamers of other gaming console still tend to buy entity games for purpose of collecting or others, and this market is still booming with more and more gamers buying game consoles. However, there doesn’t exist a comprehensive platform for players to buy entity games of different consoles from different video game companies. So here comes ICE!

ICE is an online store selling entity games from different game companies for gamers owning different gaming consoles. Authorized by the game publishers, we sell only the legal copies and provide an easy access to purchasing entity games. Besides, we encourage players to discuss the game products freely, thus to build a community gathering players from all over the world.



## Vision

A new business of an e-commerce company will be initiated: a virtual gamestore. The system to support it must manage the acquisition and selling processes of the company. 

Before the appearance of ICE, the usual way for gamers to buy entity games is buying them on online retailers like Taobao, Amazon, and so on. There are several problems about this. First, most of those entity games sold on those websites are from personal business rather than official, which will cast doubt on the quality of the products. They could be illegal copies or second handed. Additionally, the prices of the products can float because of the lack of official rules, thus chances are that gamers buy a product at a unnecessary high price. Another relative safer way to buy entity games is buying them on the official websites of the games or the publishers. However, it annoys people that they have to create different accounts for varied websites to buy games they want.

As is demonstrated above, there is an vacancy of a comprehensive entity game market where gamers with different game consoles can buy absolute legal copies of the entity games they want and publishers can attract all sorts of gamers to try their games. Actually, ICE can also serve as a community besides a store. 



## Requirements

Access of the gamestore for customers and management of the company must be accomplished through a Web site. The user can access it via PC or mobile device.

The system must allow customers to search in our system for his or her favorite game and add games to shopping cart or wish list. Gamers with different game consoles can buy all sorts of physical games easily. And what is super significant is that they need to confirm what they buy are legal copies. To ensure that, the system must maintenance a gamers forum that all customers could refer to the commets from others before buying the specific game and delivery personal opinions on a product after they purchase the game. When the game is ordered, it is delivered immediately if available in stoke, or else, the specific game is ordered to the publisher, and a compatible deadline is informed to the customer.

The system must give publishers a platform to add new games, managing game-related information, and managing orders conviniently. The functions about the information management of games are only belong to the publisher, ordinary users do not have these permissions. Besides, because publishers always look forward to a lower cut of the sale platform, with audience owning all sorts of game consoles and a lower middleman’s cut, ICE will privide a suitable share of the profit to fit publishers' demands.

The system must allow a manager to generate reports on bestselling games, and on most profitable customers, as well as suggest games for buying based on past customer’s interests. Furthermore the system must have the capability of predicting the sales in order to provide better decision (inventory, reordering products, etc.) with the solid foundation.
