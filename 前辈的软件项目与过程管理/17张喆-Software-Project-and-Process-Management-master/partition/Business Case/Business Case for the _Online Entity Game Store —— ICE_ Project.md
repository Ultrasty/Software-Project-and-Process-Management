## 1. Introduction / Background

​		ICE is an online store selling entity games from different game companies for gamers owning different gaming consoles. Authorized by the game publishers, we sell only the legal copies and provide an easy access to purchasing entity games. With the development of platform like steam and GOG, digital games seem to be the very first choice for computer gamers nowadays. However, gamers of other gaming console still tend to buy entity games for purpose of collecting or others, and this market is still booming with more and more gamers buying game consoles. However, there doesn’t exist a comprehensive platform for players to buy entity games of different consoles from different video game companies. We believe that ICE can also become a community gathering players from all over the world where they can discuss the game products freely.



## 2. Business Objective

​		ICE's strategic goals include continuous growth and profitability, as well as increasing awareness and building a platform atmosphere. This project is based on the entity game market. It hopes to attract users' favor with comprehensive and exquisite games, and optimize the work of managers with concise and refined operation methods. It will improve customer performance with excellent early warning and feedback, and gradually create a user online purchase entity games is the preferred platform and provides long-term and stable services for our buyers and partners. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to ensure sufficient game sources, and a certain amount of overhead is allowed in the early stage to increase the popularity of the platform and the complete game purchase experience.

**Specific and direct goals are:**

1. Meet business needs. ICE must be able to complete the purchase service provided to users, and provide administrators with basic business functions such as income and expenditure inventory reports.
2. Improve work efficiency. ICE needs to respond to some preset scenarios and optimize the management of administrators to improve work efficiency.
3. Improve profitability. ICE needs to complete the summary of sales reports, inventory information, etc., so that administrators can adjust business strategies in time to obtain greater profits.
4. Enhance corporate brand. ICE is committed to improving the buying experience of buyers, enhancing the visibility of the platform, strengthening the construction of atmosphere, and improving profitability from the side.



## 3. Current Situation and Problem/Opportunity Statement

​		ICE is based on the web platform. Allow a customer to search his or her favorite game in our system and add the game to a shopping cart or wish list. Gamers with different consoles can easily purchase a variety of physics games. Most importantly, they need to confirm that they purchased a legal copy. At the same time, a platform must be provided for publishers to add new games, manage game-related information, and easily manage orders. The game information management function belongs only to the publisher, and ordinary users do not have these permissions. The system must allow managers to generate reports on best-selling games and the most profitable customers, and suggest games to buy based on past customer interests. ICE will hire experienced information management and analysts to manage the various data generated by a game sales platform.

​		However, in the early stages of platform development, there needs to be enough game content for players to choose from, which requires sufficient communication with game manufacturers. At the same time, make sure that the transaction content is a legal copy. In the transitional stage of the development of the website platform, the transaction volume increases and the transaction content increases. It is necessary to control the standardization and security of platform transactions, and at the same time, pay attention to the creation of the platform atmosphere.



## 4. Critical Assumption and Constraints

​		The Web platform must be a valuable asset of ICE. The project team, including potential consultants and clients, must actively support the project. The project must achieve a noticeable increase in visibility within one year, and it is estimated that the cost will be recovered by increasing the turnover in about three years. Must run on all browsers with minimal technical support. It must be easy for users to access, and it must be protected from unauthorized users. In addition, customers can pay by credit card, Alipay or WeChat. All transactions should be guaranteed. No pirate books in stock or sold. There is no inventory or sale of used games. A third-party logistics company signs a contract to deliver all the books. Customer service personnel have acquired the relevant knowledge and skills.



## 5. Analysis of Options and Recommendation

There are three options for addressing this opportunity:

1. Do nothing. The business is doing well, and we can continue to operate without this new project.

2. Purchase access to specialized software to support this new capability with little in-house development.

3. Design and implement the new intranet capabilities in-house using mostly existing hard- ware and software.

Based on discussions with stakeholders, we believe that option 3 is the best option.



## 6. Preliminary Project Requirements

The main features of the ICE online game store include the following:

1. The system must allow customers to search in our system for his or her favorite game and add games to shopping cart or wish list. Gamers with different game consoles can buy all sorts of physical games easily. And what is super significant is that they need to confirm what they buy are legal copies. To ensure that, the system must maintenance a gamers forum that all customers could refer to the commets from others before buying the specific game and delivery personal opinions on a product after they purchase the game. When the game is ordered, it is delivered immediately if available in stoke, or else, the specific game is ordered to the publisher, and a compatible deadline is informed to the customer.

2. The system must give publishers a platform to add new games, managing game-related information, and managing orders conviniently. The functions about the information management of games are only belong to the publisher, ordinary users do not have these permissions. Besides, because publishers always look forward to a lower cut of the sale platform, with audience owning all sorts of game consoles and a lower middleman’s cut, ICE will privide a suitable share of the profit to fit publishers' demands.

3. Links to other, up-to-date Web sites, with brief descriptions of the main features of the external site.

4. Appropriate security to make the entire intranet site accessible to internal consultants and certain sections accessible to others.

5. The ability to charge money for access to some information. Some of the information and features of the intranet site should prompt external users to pay for the information or ser- vice. Payment options should include a credit card option or similar online payment trans- actions. After the system verifies payment, the user should be able to access or download the desired information.

6. Other features suggested by users, if they add value to the business.



## 7. Schedule Estimate

**Analysis**:

​		It's about the extent of uncertainty of progress of the project can be maintained and the product can be delivered on time. Schedule problems could directly lead to the

loss of marketing opportunities and even the contract breach. The risk is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1. **Delay**

   Once a delay occurs, that means the following activities relating to this part will be all suspended. And of course the demanded deliveables will be a joke. 

2. **Expediting**

   If the team needs to do expediting work to meet the milestones or deadlines, inevitably, there will be overtime work, which brings extra costs and may cause staff's dissat isficat ion.

3. **Short-term Response**

   Improve the frequency of catching schedule information. We could use Scrum method to make short sprints. Burn-down chart is recommended to use in this case. Then we may enable staged delivery of products, increase the frequency and intensity of project monitoring, and more use a viable way to ensure the quality of work to avoid rework. In the implementation of the project time schedule management, maybe an experienced project manager is need to fully consider the various potential factors, the appropriate leave; task decomposition should be detailed, easy to assess.

## 8. Potential Risks

### 8.1 Requirement Risks

1. **Missing Stakeholders**

   The requirements management process fails identify or engage all stakeholders. For example, some entity games are appearing on the market but sales isn't involved in the project.

2. **Wrong Stakeholders**

   Stakeholders who don't have the requisite knowledge, skills or authority to deliver, validate or sign off on requirements. For example, requirements gathering may be assigned to junior employees who have inadequate access to experts in the organization.

3. **Ambiguous Requirements**

   Requirements that are defined in such a way that they are open to misinterpretation. In some cases, stakeholders may intentionally define open-ended requirements in order to avoid making a decision or to protect themselves politically. In other cases, requirements are simply poorly worded.

4. **Incomplete Requirements**

   Requirements that are incomplete leading to deliverables that are unstable, unusable or are generally unacceptable. For example, requirements for a system that make no mention of a user interface. Incomplete requirements can also refer to a set of requirements that are focused on functional requirements without adequate consideration of business and non-functional requirements.

5. **Conflicting Requirements**

   Requirements are often given by different individuals who each present a wish list that may conflict in various ways. The owner of the requirements may fail to resolve such conflicts.

6. **Infeasible Requirements**

   Requirements that go well beyond the capabilities of the organization or system to which they apply. These risks can be mitigated with a quick feasibility or cost assessment.

### 8.2 Security Risks

1. **Cross-site scripting**

   For example a JavaScript snippet is embedded in a vulnerable web page and used to access cookie data, impersonate website visitors, and steal private data such as credit card information.

2. **Phishing**

   Valid customers are tricked by fake emails into updating their account information or changing their password; this data is then stolen and used by fraudsters.

3. **Bad bots**

   Can occur when an insecure Wi-Fi network is used or the website data is not encrypted. Fraudsters can listen in on consumer movements and collect personal data.

4.  **Man-in-the-middle attacks**

   Can occur when an insecure Wi-Fi network is used or the website data is not encrypted. Fraudsters can listen in on consumer movements and collect personal data.

5. **Malware**

   Often inserted into the merchant website as a result of phishing or an SQL injection. This malware is used to control the merchant’s website, giving the fraudster complete control and access to the site and data.



### 8.3 Cost Risks

​		Project cost is a component that must be considered in risk management. For the Online Entity Game Store —— ICE, our cost mainly lies in system development, entity games management. The risks are as follows: if a certain cost increases sharply in a short term, it is difficult for the game store to make ends meet leading to a big loss or even closure finally.

### 8.4 Team Risks

​		The development of software is different from other projects, it is intellectual-intensive, labor-intensive, project, greatly affected by the staff resources. Software development in different engineering stages need different personnel, as a result the same team members need to work closely with each other. In the process of human resources use, the performance of the whole team is often reflected in the progress of the project development as well as the performance of the software. If the team lacked the team spirit and high morale, the progress of software development will be slowed down greatly and the performance of the product can not be ensured, which will cause great damage to the whole company.

### 8.5 Schedule Risks

1. **Delay**

   Once a delay occurs, that means the following activities relating to this part will be all suspended. And of course the demanded deliverables will be a joke.

2. **Expediting**

   If the team needs to do expediting work to meet the milestones or deadlines, inevitably, there will be overtime work, which brings extra costs and may cause staff's dissatisfication.

### 8.6 Market Risks

​		The software is based on the needs of the market and the user to design and development, so the success of a software is whether the market can be recognized in a timely manner to meet the needs of users, a lot of time, may not be completed before the product is put into operation, There have been other similar software or systems to enter the market, taking the initiative, resulting in the development of products into the market after the lack of competitiveness, low profit margins.
