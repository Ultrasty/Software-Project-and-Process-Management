**Project Objectives:** Develop an e-commerce platform for selling physical games to help game merchants and external customers conduct transactions more effectively. The platform will include many efficient functions. Users can search game products in various ways, learn about their details, collect or purchase them. Users can also comment on the purchased products as an important reference for other users to select products. At the same time, we provide stores with the background management platform, where businesses can operate the game on, off and modify, as well as delivery and logistics functions. The e-commerce platform is managed by the administrator and provides all kinds of effective report analysis data.

**Main Project Success Criteria:**

**Approach:**

- Conduct a survey to determine the key functions of ICE's web platform and solicit user opinions through possible means such as questionnaires.
- View examples of internal and external templates and project management documents.
- Research platform plugins or other possible technologies to provide security, manage user input and facilitate the functionality and security of the transaction process.
- Use prototype development and iterative methods to develop a web platform based on agile processes to solicit a large amount of user feedback.
- Identify a way to increase platform's repute during the project and within one year after the project is completed. Also discuss how to increase transaction recovery costs within three years.
